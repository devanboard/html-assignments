    <p>Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Exercising the imagination,
        experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Just
        pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.
​
        You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. That's why I paint -
        because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Only God can
        make a tree - but you can paint one. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Trees cover up a multitude of sins.
        There we go.
​
        Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Son of a gun. A little happy sunlight shining through there.
​
        Put it in, leave it alone. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Put light against light - you have nothing.
        Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one
        meaning. In your world you can create anything you desire. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.
        Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen.
    </p>
​
    <p>It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push
        them out. Anything you want to do you can do here. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse
        is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. This piece of canvas is your world.
​
        Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Take your time. Speed will come later. There he comes. I'm gonna
        add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. We don't really
        know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.
​
        You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Every single thing in the world has its own personality -
        and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost
        like a chocolate brown. You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Making all those little fluffies
        that live in the clouds.
